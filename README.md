# Marlin for TAM S1 2013 (wood) with Full Graphic Smart Controller

Marlin 1.1 firmware configurated to run on a Type A Machine Series 1 3D printer from 2013 (plywood frame) equipped with a [DiscountRepRap Full Graphics Smart controller with LCD display and SD card reader](http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller).

The printer has a RAMPS1.4 card but it is wired a bit different from the standard way so the pins had to be reconfigured to account for things like that the two Y-motors are connected to the connectors marked with Z, among other things.
